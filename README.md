#  Dental Center Management Dashboard (Frontend Only)

This is a **React-based frontend dashboard** built for ENTNT's Dental Center Management System. It simulates a real-world clinic management system with role-based access, patient and appointment management, and file uploads â€” all using `localStorage` with no backend.
